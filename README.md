# AI in AEC Summer School - ETH Zurich

Welcome to the repository for the AI in AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) Summer School at ETH Zurich! This repository contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks designed to provide hands-on exercises and examples in applying Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques within the AEC industry. 

## Contents

- **Notebooks**: Each notebook is a standalone exercise focusing on different aspects of ML and DL, from basic concepts to more advanced applications.
- **Data**: Includes example datasets used throughout the exercises.
- **Resources**: Additional reading materials, references, and links to further learning resources.

## Objectives

Through these exercises, participants will learn how to:

- Implement and evaluate machine learning models.
- Process and analyze real-world data.
- Apply ML solutions to engineering and construction challenges.

Each notebook is independent and focuses on a specific topic or technique. We hope this series will provide helpful in building a solid foundation for understanding and leveraging AI in AEC applications.
