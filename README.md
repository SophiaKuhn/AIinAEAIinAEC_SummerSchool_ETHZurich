# AI in AEC Summer School - ETH Zurich

Welcome to the repository for the [Design++](https://designplusplus.ethz.ch) [Summer School AI in AEC 2024](https://designplusplus.ethz.ch/education/summer-school.html) at ETH Zurich! This repository contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks designed to provide hands-on exercises and examples in applying Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques within the AEC industry. 

## Contents

- **Notebooks**: Each notebook is a standalone exercise focusing on different aspects of ML and DL, from basic concepts to more advanced applications.
- **Data**: Includes example datasets used throughout the exercises.
- **Resources**: Additional reading materials, references, and links to further learning resources.

## Objectives

Through these exercises, participants will learn how to:

- Implement and evaluate machine learning models.
- Process and analyze real-world data.
- Apply ML solutions to engineering and construction challenges.

Each notebook is independent and focuses on a specific topic or technique. We hope this series will provide helpful in building a solid foundation for understanding and leveraging AI in AEC applications.


## Getting Started

To get the most out of these exercises, we recommend downloading the notebooks introduced in class and exploring them in detail. Follow the steps below to set up your environment and start working with the exercises:

1. **Download the Notebooks**: Download the entire repository or the specific notebooks that interest you. Each notebook is designed to be self-contained, allowing you to focus on individual topics or techniques at your own pace.

2. **Set Up Your Environment**: Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your computer. You can use virtual environments or Anaconda to manage dependencies effectively.

3. **Install Required Packages**: Each notebook includes a list of necessary packages in its installation instructions. Follow these instructions to install the required libraries and dependencies.

4. **Run the Notebooks**: Open Jupyter Notebook, navigate to the directory where you have saved the downloaded notebooks, and start experimenting. Each exercise is designed to provide hands-on experience, so feel free to modify the code and explore different scenarios/ parameters.

These notebooks can also serve as a foundation for your mini-projects. You can use the code snippets provided in these notebooks as a starting point and adapt them to address the specific challenges you are tackling in your projects with your team.
